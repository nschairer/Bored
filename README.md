# Bored
This app has various features based off different topics of things to do when you are bored. The first is read which pulls book genres from the NYT bestseller list, you can then choose a genre and see the top books within it (all based on the NYT bestsellers). Also you can click on the book to take you to its amazon link if you are interested.

Then there is the learn section, this has several categories to choose from. Business, Sports, Science, Programming, and math are the current selection (however math has not been setup yet). Once you click on them the app pushes you to a screen displaying various articles from those topics. This was achieved using an xml parser for rss feeds and an enum to hold the different categories.

Listen and watch simply show titles of music and video apps on your phone, you can click on them to take you to said apps. Play has not been finished yet either, I was thinking it could be pong or snake, some simple game to entertain you when you're bored enough to make an app named bored.
